The culmination of Summer 2013 at Grata, a start-up in Beijing engaged in cloud-based analytics for luxury hotels.

This product was something I took from start to finish: 

A user interface designed for staff that generates a custom short url. 

The relevant code can be found under customize.php. 

The UI implements a variety of functions in addition to the short url generator including:

-mobile OS detection
-browser redirect
-app store redirect
-QR code generator
-integrated google analytics
-link expiration
-click analytics
